### *Hi there!* I'm Sergey and here is my repository for tracking tasks' progress during kottans course. :wave: :grin:

#### Let the study begin!

## General Basics

- [x] 0. [Git and GitHub](git_and_github/git_and_github.md)

  It took a bit more time then I expected to understand some things in work with Git and GitHub. I finally finished course on Udacity [How to use Git and GitHub](git_and_github/git_and_github.md), it was a bit boring but useful. Also I passed some courses on [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/) and finished [GitHowTo](git_and_github/git_and_github.md). Had fun on [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/).

- [ ] 1.Linux CLI and Networking

- [ ] 2.VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration
