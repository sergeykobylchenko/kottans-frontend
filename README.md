# kottans-frontend
### *Hi there!* I'm Sergey and here is my repository for tracking tasks' progress during kottans course. :wave: :grin:

#### Let the study begin!

## General Basics

- [x] 0.[Git and GitHub](git_and_github/git_and_github.md)

  It took a bit more time then I expected to understand some things in work with Git and GitHub. I finally finished course on Udacity [How to use Git and GitHub](git_and_github/git_and_github.md), it was a bit boring but useful. Also I passed some courses on [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/) and finished [GitHowTo](git_and_github/git_and_github.md). Had fun on [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/).

- [x] 1.[Linux CLI and Networking](task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.md)

  For a long time wanted to learn how to use command line, I thought that it's difficult thing but [the course is done](task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.md) and I like it, it's usefull and powerfull tool to work with. The next step is installing Linux on my laptop and work with it as with Windows OS.

  HTTP articles are a bit confusing for me. I have read them, but I used this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys2CB4C2NWA&list=PLrCZzMib1e9qZwq95WVmGB-acnot5ka4a) as additional info. 

- [ ] 2.VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration
